# Test Automation for Depop

## Description 
Using Selenium and Typescript to run BDD tests that search for an item, check that there are results, add the first result to a bag and then go to checkout

## Would have likeds
I would like to add more testing for real payments, and perhaps to add multiple items to the bag
